# Blink Health Frontend take home.

## Where to start?

Open index.html in your favorite code editor and in your browser. You should be able to complete the tasks directly in the html file.

## What are we building here?

We are going to build a Github user browser based on this outline:

1.  a search input for looking up Github users
2.  a ui for displaying the search results
3.  each result should be clickable and when clicked should display the user's repositories
4.  When viewing the user repositories, each should display the number of open pull requests

## FAQ's

#### What am I evaluated on?

Write code that you are happy with and feel comfortable talking about. Focus on getting to fully-working solution.

#### Can I use libraries?

Sure, just add what you need to the index file.

#### Why React?

Its what we use in our products, but if you want to use vanilla JS, or another library or framework, go ahead!

#### Do I need to style my app?

We don't expect a polished design but some style would earn you extra points. You can use a css framework or write style from scratch.

#### Which browser should i use?

Using the latest Chrome version should cover all modern Javascript syntax.
